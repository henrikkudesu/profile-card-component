## My process
I structured the html in a semantic way, then finished styling the elements.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
I learned to avoid using height to define the size of elements, as this can break the responsiveness of the html. HTML is already responsive by default, there is no need to tweak the height of elements (in most cases).

### Continued development
Gotta improve it in the future.
